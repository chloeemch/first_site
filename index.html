            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p> 
            
            <p>Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>
